# Java Mastery for Backend Development

This repository is a study and practice roadmap for achieving mastery in backend development with Java. It starts with advanced Java language concepts and JVM fundamentals, then moves into database access, the Spring ecosystem, testing, deployment, architecture patterns, and real-world project ideas.

## How to use this repository

- Navigate to each section's README to find topics and links to detailed explanations.

- Each section contains markdown files explaining key concepts, along with code samples in the `codes` subdirectory.

- If stuck or needing clarification, refer to official documentation or trusted Java resources.


- Follow the topics in order, practicing with the code examples and building your own projects as you go.

## Contents

- ### [Core Java Concepts](Core%20Java/README.md)

  - #### [Strings and Memory Management](Core%20Java/Strings/)


## Goals / Intended outcomes

- Become fluent with advanced Java (concurrency, JVM internals, performance).

- Master robust data access using JDBC, JPA and Spring Data.

- Build production-ready REST APIs and microservices using Spring Boot.

- Design, secure, test, and deploy backend services (CI/CD, containers, observability).

- Gain hands-on experience with real project builds and common backend patterns.



## Contribution & workflow

- Use branches per feature or project.
- Include tests and a README for each sample project.
