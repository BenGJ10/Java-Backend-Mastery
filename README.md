# Java Mastery for Backend Development

This repository is a study and practice roadmap for achieving mastery in backend development with Java. It starts with advanced Java language concepts and JVM fundamentals, then moves into database access, the Spring ecosystem, testing, deployment, architecture patterns, and real-world project ideas.

## Goals / Intended outcomes

- Become fluent with advanced Java (concurrency, JVM internals, performance).

- Master robust data access using JDBC, JPA and Spring Data.

- Build production-ready REST APIs and microservices using Spring Boot.

- Design, secure, test, and deploy backend services (CI/CD, containers, observability).

- Gain hands-on experience with real project builds and common backend patterns.
