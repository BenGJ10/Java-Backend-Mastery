# Spring Boot Web

This section focuses on building web applications using Spring Boot. It covers essential topics such as setting up a Spring Boot web project, creating RESTful APIs, handling web requests, and integrating with front-end technologies.

## How to Use This Section

- Each topic should be organized into its own subdirectory with markdown explanations and code samples.

- Code examples demonstrating various Spring Boot web features should be stored in the `codes/` folder.

- Each markdown file should provide clear explanations, diagrams, and code snippets to illustrate key concepts.
